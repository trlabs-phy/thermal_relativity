# Thermal Relativity: Planck Epoch Simulations

This repository contains Python scripts supporting the **Thermal Relativity** framework developed by T. Matthew Ressler. These simulations explore fundamental thermodynamic and temporal principles as applied to the early universe — particularly within and around the Planck epoch.

## Overview

Thermal Relativity is a cosmological model that unifies thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology by redefining time as a measurable quantity and proposing a Thermal Energy Conversion Cycle (TECC) as the clock of the universe.

The simulations in this repository include entropy flow modeling, the thermodynamic arrow of time, absolute time calibration, and gravitational compression effects — key processes around the Planck scale.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `entropy_as_the_clock_planck.py` | Models entropy as a function of thermal time, supporting the hypothesis that entropy increase acts as a clock. |
| `time_proof_planck.py` | Computes quantitative evidence for absolute time based on thermodynamic and gravitational variables. |
| `arrow_of_time_planck.py` | Visualizes and simulates the thermodynamic arrow of time in early cosmology. |
| `earth_ptf_planck.py` | Aligns Earth's proper time field (PTF) with the Absolute Time Field (ATF) using gravitational potentials. |
| `absolute_time_redshift_planck.py` | Connects redshift and cosmic expansion to an Absolute Time framework during the Planck epoch. |

## Requirements
All scripts use standard scientific Python packages. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Each script is self-contained and can be executed directly:

python entropy_as_the_clock_planck.py

Graphical outputs and console data will demonstrate key relationships and principles.

## Background
These scripts are developed to accompany the Time as a Measurement thesis and broader Thermal Relativity framework. For the full theory, equations, and publications, see:
