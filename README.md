# Thermal Relativity: Planck Epoch Simulations

This repository contains Python scripts supporting the **Thermal Relativity** framework developed by T. Matthew Ressler. These simulations explore fundamental thermodynamic and temporal principles as applied to the early universe — particularly within and around the Planck epoch.

## Overview

Thermal Relativity is a cosmological model that unifies thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology by redefining time as a measurable quantity and proposing a Thermal Energy Conversion Cycle (TECC) as the clock of the universe.

The simulations in this repository include entropy flow modeling, the thermodynamic arrow of time, absolute time calibration, and gravitational compression effects — key processes around the Planck scale.

## Thermal Relativity: Time as a Measurement

This repository contains Python simulations supporting the **Thermal Relativity** framework, which redefines time as a measurable quantity driven by entropy and expansion.

These simulations focus on the thermodynamic and temporal dynamics of the early universe, specifically spanning the Planck epoch through the onset of cosmic inflation and redshift formation.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `absolute_time_redshift_planck.py` | Connects redshift and cosmic expansion to an Absolute Time framework during the Planck epoch. |
| `arrow_of_time_planck.py` | Visualizes and simulates the thermodynamic arrow of time in early cosmology. |
| `time_proof_planck.py` | Computes quantitative evidence for absolute time based on thermodynamic and gravitational variables. |
| `earth_ptf_planck.py` | Aligns Earth's proper time field (PTF) with the Absolute Time Field (ATF) using gravitational potentials. |
| `entropy_as_the_clock_planck.py` | Models entropy as a function of thermal time, supporting the hypothesis that entropy increase acts as a clock. |


## Requirements
All scripts use standard scientific Python packages. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Each script is self-contained and can be executed directly:

```bash
python entropy_as_the_clock_planck.py
```
Graphical outputs and console data will demonstrate key relationships and principles.

## Background
These scripts are developed to accompany the Time as a Measurement thesis and broader Thermal Relativity framework. For the full theory, equations, and publications, see:
